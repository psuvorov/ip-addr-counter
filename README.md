# Unique IP addresses counter

Given a plain text file containing IPv4 on each line, like:

```
145.67.23.4
8.34.5.23
89.54.3.124
89.54.3.124
3.45.71.5
...
```

The file isn't limited in size, it can have tens and hundreds of gigabytes. Let's try to count the unique number of IP addresses from that file.
